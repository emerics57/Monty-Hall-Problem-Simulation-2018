    "The Monty Hall Problem is a classic gameshow probability problem. In this game, there are three doors. Two of the doors are null, possessing nothing or something undesirable behind them (we will denote these as losing doors). One of the doors posseses something desirable behind it (we will denote this as a winning door). Within the monty_hall_sim() function, losing doors are encoded as 1, while the winning door is encoded as a 0. \n",
    "\n",
    "In Monty Hall game, the gameshow host initially asks the contestant to choose one of the three doors. The contestant chooses a door at random with a 1/3 probability of choosing the winning door. The initial_selection() function incorporates this randomized door choice. The host then sets this door aside. Next, the host opens one of the doors, to reveal it is null. He then asks, with the options left, if the contestant would like to switch from his original door choice to the only remaining door. Typically, most contestants would stick with their gut instinct. The \"correct\" answer based on probabalistic measures is to always switch doors. This is because the removal of one of the options after your intital choice, actually results in the remaining door having a larger probability of being the winning one.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can think of this in a simple way. Our first choice of door possessed a 1/3 probability of being the winning door. This leaves 2/3 probability that the winning door is one of the other two unselected doors (or is elsewhere). When one of those unselected doors is revealed to be null, there is still a 2/3 probability that the winning door is elsewhere, other than the originally chosen door. This leaves the last remaining door with a 2/3 probability of being a win, while the originally selected door is a 1/3 probability of being a win and a 2/3 probability of being a loss. \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore our expected probability of winning if we always switch our choice is 2/3. In other words, the true probability of success if the contestant chooses to switch is 2/3. We will verify this empirically using simulation. So, our simulation should gradually converge towards a a 66.667% percentage of winning the game. In the terms of the below simulation, the choice of door will be randomized. The contestants decision to switch will be constant. We will verify the probablity of success with switching choices.\n",
    "\n",
    "For help in understanding the if and else statements within the monty_hall_sim() function: Since the gameshow host always reveals a null (losing) door, we can infer that if the contestants intital choice is null, a switch of choice will always result in a win. Therefore the if and else statements are organized so that \"if 1 (null door), then add 1 to switch_won counter\" and \"if 0 (winning door), add 1 to the switch_lost counter.\" \n",
    "\n",
    "This true probability of success in this problem can be theoretically computed using Bayes Theorem for calculating conditional probabilities:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \n",
    "P(A|B) = \\frac{P(B|A)}{P(B)}P(A)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use Bayes Theorem to calculate the probability of winning when we switch door choices. This is equivalent to the probablity of door 3 winning given that the host has removed door 2, $P(D_3|R_2)$ (in the assumed event that we initially chose door 1). So, this can be thought of as the probability of winning when we do switch our choice of door from 1 to 3. Below, we see the formula to be used to compute this probability: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \n",
    "P(D_3|R_2) = \\frac{P(R_2|D_3)P(D_3)}{P(R_2)}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we will substitute the respective probabilities into this formula and solve. $P(R_2|D_3)$ is 1 because it is the probability of removing door 2, given that door 3 is the winning door. This makes sense because we assume door 1 has already been chosen; therefore, if the host knows the winning door is door 3, the only door left to remove is door 2. $P(D_3)$, the unconditional probability of choosing door 3 out of three possible doors with one randomly distributed winning door is 1/3. This probability is the same for any door. \n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, we must calculate, $P(R_2)$, the probability of removing door 2 without conditions that the prize is any specified location. We see below that:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(R_2) = P(D_1)P(R_2|D_1) + P(D_2)P(R_2|D_2) + P(D_3)P(R_2|D_3)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore $P(R_2)$ is the sum of 3 probability spaces, accounting for all the possible situations in which door 2 could be removed (if door 1, 2, or 3 is initially chosen, respectively). We have already found that $P(D_1)$ = $P(D_2)$ = $P(D_3)$ = 1/3. $P(R_2|D_1)$, the probability that door 2 is removed given that door 1 is the winning door, is 1/2 because if the winning door is known, there are only two possible losing doors that could be removed. $P(R_2|D_2)$, the probability of removing door 2 given that door 2 is the winning door is 0 because the host of the Monty Hall gameshow would never reveal the winning door. That would defeat the purpose of the game. Finally, $P(R_2|D_3)$, the probability of removing door 2 given that door 3 is the winning door equals 1. This is because, as explained above regarding the if/else statments in the algorithm, if door 1 is assumed to be intitally chosen, and door 3 is the winning door, the only viable door left to remove is door 2. If we substitute in the above probabilities to our equation, we are able to compute: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \n",
    "P(D_3|R_2) = \\frac{P(R_2|D_3)P(D_3)}{P(R_2)} = \\frac{(1)(\\frac{1}{3})}{\\frac{1}{3}(\\frac{1}{2} + 0 + 1)} = \\frac{2}{3}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, we will proceed with simulation to verify the convergence of the probability of success with switching doors to 2/3. "
